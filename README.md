### Server/NAS storage Implementation
The project focuses on the realization of an economic Raspberry Pi server/NAS storage. The goals to achive are:
* configuraion of a web interface;
* possibility of uploading documents from web interface to remote host;
* implementation of the NAS storage with RAID memory configuration;
* coding UI to let admin check the status of the server/NAS storage.


Thanks to the implementation of an LCD touch screen on the board the admin will be able to control the remaining storage, the registered users and the CPU status. This is achived through a custom GUI compiled in g++.
