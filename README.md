### Server/NAS storage Implementation
The project focuses on the realization of an economic Raspberry Pi server/NAS storage. The goals to achieve are:
* configuration of a web interface;
* possibility of uploading documents from web interface to remote host;
* implementation of the NAS storage with RAID memory configuration;
* coding UI to let admin check the status of the server/NAS storage.


Thanks to the implementation of a LCD touch screen (Adafruit 2.8") the admin will be able to control the remaining storage, the registered users and the CPU status. This is achieved through a custom GUI compiled in g++.
